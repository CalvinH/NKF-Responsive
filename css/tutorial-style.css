NESTING 

Often when writing CSS, you’ll have several selectors that all begin with the same thing. 
For example, you might have “#navbar ul”, “#navbar li”, and “#navbar li a”. 
It’s a pain to repeat the beginning over and over again, especially when it gets long.
Sass allows you to avoid this by nesting the child selectors within the parent selector.

*/
#navbar {
  width: 80%;
  height: 24px; }
  #navbar ul {
    list-style-type: none; }
  #navbar li {
    float: left; }
    #navbar li a {
      font-weight: bold; }

/*

Notice how the output is formatted to reflect the original nesting of the selectors. 
This is the default CSS style, but there are other styles for all sorts of CSS formatting preferences. 
There’s even one for compressing the CSS as much as possible!

Be aware that nesting selectors does have a cost in terms of code size and maintainability. 
You don’t want to exactly match the nesting of the HTML; that makes it very difficult to update your 
CSS when the HTML changes in small ways. It’s generally a good idea to prefer only two or three levels 
of nesting.

You can also nest properties, so you don’t have to repeat stuff like “border-left-” all the time.
